   i usually interact with anyone but i will avoid interacting as much with people younger than 15 that arent already friends with me

 <p align="center">    i not so often, say slurs i can reclaim, like the n-word being an afrolatino person, say flirty and sexual jokes if youre around my age and i see youre comfortable with it

   i always sit with my friends, if you see me sitting by myself, im probably upset but i will likely respond if you talk to me, also you might see me on 18+ with my [best friend](https://1-29-22.carrd.co/)
